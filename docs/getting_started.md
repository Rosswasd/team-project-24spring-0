# Get Started

> Embark on your coding journey with Moras. This section provides all the necessary information to get you set up and 
> ready. From installation to creating your first project, weâ€™ll guide you through each step to ensure a smooth start.

## ðŸ’¿Installation

**Step 1: Download the Installer**
Begin by downloading the latest version of Moras from our official website or GitHub repository. Look for the file named `moras_v0.2.0.exe` for Windows `moras_v0.2.0.dmg` for macOS.

**Step 2: Run the Installer**
Once the download is complete, locate the file in your Downloads folder and double-click to run the installer. Follow the on-screen instructions to proceed with the installation.

**Step 3: Accept the License Agreement**
Read through the license agreement carefully. If you agree to the terms, select 'I Agree' to continue with the installation.

**Step 4: Choose Installation Location**
Select the destination folder where you want Moras to be installed. The default location is usually recommended for most users.

**Step 5: Complete the Installation**
After selecting the installation location, click 'Install' to begin the process. A progress bar will indicate the installation status. Once completed, click 'Finish' to exit the installer.

## ðŸ”§Setup

**Step 1:** Launch Moras Find the Moras icon on your desktop or in your applications folder and double-click to open the IDE.

**Step 2:** Open a Project To start coding.

Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the layout of Moras. Notice the toolbar, editor window, and sidebar.

With MORAS installed and set up, youâ€™re now ready to begin your coding adventure. Should you encounter any issues, refer to the help document for assistance.

## ðŸ‘‹First Project â€”â€” Creating "*Hello Moras!*"

The most basic code that could be made in C is something like:

```
int main(){
    puts("Hello Moras!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
We don't have access to the C standard library though so lets turn puts into a call to `write(fd,buffer,len)` which 
directly maps to a Linux system call. And let's also lift the definition of the string into a global variable because 
assembly language doesn't allow strings as arguments.

This leaves us with some directly translatable C code:

```
char* str = "Hello Moras!\n"
int main(){
    write(1,str,13);
    return 0;
}
```

The first line can be translated into assembly as:
```
.data # Tell the assembler we are defining data not code
str:  # Label this position in memory so it can be referred to in our code 
.string "Hello Moras!\n" # Copy the string "Hello Moras!\n" into memory 
```

To start defining the main function we will use the code:

```
.text # Tell the assembler that we are writing code (text) now 
main: # Make a label to say where our program should start from
```

The body of main is a little harder to directly translate because you have to set up each of the arguments to the system
call one by one. In total `write(1,str,13)` will take 5 instructions:

```
li a0, 1   # li means to Load Immediate and we want to load the value 1 into register a0
la a1, str # la is similar to li, but works for loading addresses
li a2, 13  # like the first line, but with 13. This is the final argument to the system call
li a7, 64  # a7 is what determines which system call we are calling and we what to call write (64)
ecall      # actually issue the call
```

`return 0` is going to need to be changed a little before we can translate it. To exit cleanly we will need to use the 
exit system call.

```
li a0, 0  # The exit code we will be returning is 0
li a7, 93 # Again we need to indicate what system call we are making and this time we are calling exit(93)
ecall 
```

Putting all of those snippets together we get the code:

```
.data # Tell the assembler we are defining data not code
str:  # Label this position in memory so it can be referred to in our code 
  .string "Hello Moras!\n" # Copy the string "Hello Moras!\n" into memory 

.text # Tell the assembler that we are writing code (text) now 
main: # Make a label to say where our program should start from

  li a0, 1   # li means to Load Immediate and we want to load the value 1 into register a0
  la a1, str # la is similar to li, but works for loading addresses
  li a2, 13  # like the first line, but with 13. This is the final argument to the system call
  li a7, 64  # a7 is what determines which system call we are calling and we what to call write (64)
  ecall      # actually issue the call

  li a0, 0   # The exit code we will be returning is 0
  li a7, 93  # Again we need to indicate what system call we are making and this time we are calling exit(93)
  ecall 
```
